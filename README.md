## What Is The Edison Wave?

[**The Edison Wave is a digital audio program**](https://theedisionwave.com/) designed to guide the brain into a calm yet alert mental state. It does not use pills, supplements, or physical devices. Users listen to a short sound track through headphones.

The audio targets **alpha brain waves**, which usually range from **8 to 12 Hz**. These brain waves link with relaxed focus, clear thinking, and steady attention. Many people reach this state during light meditation or creative work.

Edison Wave delivers this experience without long sessions or complex steps. Users press play, listen, and go on with their day.

## How The Edison Wave Works

The process stays simple and easy to follow.

### Step 1: Brainwave Entrainment Through Sound

The audio uses steady sound patterns that encourage the brain to match a specific rhythm. This process is known as brainwave entrainment.

### Step 2: Alpha Brain Wave Activation

Alpha brain waves support calm focus. Studies in neuroscience link this range to reduced mental tension and better attention control.

### Step 3: Short Listening Sessions

Most users listen once per day. Sessions stay brief, which fits busy schedules.

### Meditation Comparison

Traditional meditation often takes weeks of practice. Edison Wave aims to guide the brain faster using sound, without requiring silence, posture control, or long sessions.

### Device Compatibility

Users can listen to:

- Smartphones
- Tablets
- Laptops
- Standard headphones or earbuds

No special equipment is required.
